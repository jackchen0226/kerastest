Read on creating multi-layered networks.
Attempted to use graphviz, attempt again on windows?
Used GaussianDropout(), improved results? Needs more trials

Ideas:
	Compare to users on social media (reddit, twitter?) in terms of cadence, writing style, typos, etc.
	Using image recognition for real life size of objects (use 1 object as a scale to meaasure other object)
Will get more ideas later in future...
