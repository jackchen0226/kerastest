Images are available but very basic. Need's reshaping to view digits but the tensor can be viewed.
Clamp is difficult to create mostly because of Keras unable to convert a numpy array into a tensor. May need to incorporate tensorflow into it? Also not sure if completely necesary do to the image outputs (not much difference from dense to noise)
Also need to switch to something else pretty soon. REsearch more datasets on Kaggle.
