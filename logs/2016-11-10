Place range on data before applying gaussian noise
	(so that data after noise does not become a negative pixel value)
Create images using scipy imsave() after the first Dense layer to observe what happens
	Might need a bit of funny business in order to make an image
Science fair, check with Ms. Samson
Change seed for reproducibilty for future tests
